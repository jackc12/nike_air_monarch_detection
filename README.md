# nike_air_monarch_detection
Convolutional neural network that detects the Nike Air Monarch using TensorFlow. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (I recommend python 3.5 or 3.6 as they are more stable than python 3.7 as of 11/18). Clone repo, follow [TensorFlow installation guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) and install [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install) by running the command `python3 -m pip install jupyter`. Run `jupyter notebook nike_air_monarch.ipynb` from this directory in the command line to start the notebook. After the notebook opens click cells and then click run all cells.
